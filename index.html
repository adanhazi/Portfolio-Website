        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in one of the most remote regions of the Horn of Africa, where resources were scarce but my passion for learning and resilience thrived. Even as a child, I excelled in mathematics and the sciences, distinguishing myself as one of the top students in my school. After a tragic incident that resulted in a dire teacher shortage, my former principal invited me to return as an untrained teacher shortly after I completed my secondary education. Although I initially never considered teaching, the pressing need in my community and my strong academic background compelled me to step up. Eventually, I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Education in Science at university. During this time, I acquired a laptop, nurtured my computer skills, and took on data entry assignments, which not only provided me with additional income but also honed my technological proficiency. These experiences forged my commitment to both education and service, and they continue to shape my professional journey as I strive to be a resource and inspiration for those around me.</p>
